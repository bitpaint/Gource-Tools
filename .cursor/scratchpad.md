# Gource-Tools Project Documentation Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
The FFmpeg worker is a critical component of the Gource-Tools application that handles video processing with elevated permissions. A thorough investigation into its functionality is needed to document it properly and ensure that users understand its operation.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- The FFmpeg worker operates with maximum permissions to handle file operations that may require elevated access
- It uses platform-specific commands (PowerShell on Windows) to ensure proper file handling
- It manages temporary files and directories in the system's temp folder
- It handles the complexity of building and executing FFmpeg commands with various filters and options

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Analyze FFmpegWorker.js Implementation**
   - Review the code structure
   - Document core functionality
   - Identify platform-specific handling
   - Success criteria: Complete understanding of all worker functions and their purpose

2. **Understand Integration with FFmpegService**
   - Review how the worker is used by the service layer
   - Document the API between the service and worker
   - Success criteria: Clear documentation of the integration points

3. **Document FFmpeg Permissions Handling**
   - Analyze how elevated permissions are managed
   - Document platform-specific approaches (Windows vs Unix)
   - Success criteria: Clear explanation of the permission model

4. **Create Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Update README with detailed FFmpeg worker section
   - Include platform-specific notes
   - Document common issues and solutions
   - Success criteria: Complete, accurate documentation in the README
